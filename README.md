#API_navigator

This was an assignment that I did while attending Kenzie Academy. 
This project used an API key that I was assigned from flickr.com.
There is a popup that requests the location of the user which pulls the longitude and latitude to find an array of photos near the users location.
Once the photos come up there is a next button that cycles through 5 different photos in an array.

I googled the information on how to get the longitude and the latitude from the user.
I made the fetch search for animal photos but also fiddled with it to pull other objects as well.

I only added JavaScript to this project.
